## Subject: Immediate Clinical Review Required – Severe Weight Loss, Dysphagia, and Nutritional Decline

Dear [Facility Manager / Doctor's Name],

I am writing to formally request urgent intervention for **Mr Tinh [Surname]**, aged 62, who has experienced **critical weight loss** (from over 70 kg to 48 kg) and displays **persistent dysphagia with coughing**. This places him at imminent risk of **malnutrition, muscle wasting, and aspiration pneumonia**.

Despite apparent data collection by the facility, there is **no clear multidisciplinary intervention plan currently in place**. Given the scale of his decline, this constitutes a serious risk to life and wellbeing.

## Requested Actions

   - Full swallowing assessment under **IDDSI framework**
